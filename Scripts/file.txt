Selenium is a widely used tool for automated browser testing. Being an open-source framework allowed Selenium to be compatible with multiple test automation frameworks for different programming languages and if we talk about Automation testing with Selenium and JavaScript, there is a particular framework that never fails to take the spotlight and that is the Nightwatch.js. This is why I decided to come up with Nightwatch.js tutorial for beginners.

In this blog post, we will deep dive into a step by step Nightwatch JS tutorial to perform testing with Selenium and JavaScript for automated browser testing. We will explore how we can install and setup Nightwatch JS and look into details about its configuration and the important files and folder structure. Later we will also look at executing our first Nightwatch.js test automation script and what are some of the issues that we might encounter, along with their resolutions. Letâ€™s kickstart this Nightwatch.js tutorial for beginners with a basic introduction.

What Is Nightwatch.js?
Powered by Node.js, Nightwatch.js is an open-source automated testing framework that aims at providing complete E2E (end to end) solutions to automate testing with Selenium Javascript for web-based applications, browser applications, and websites. This framework relies on Selenium and provides several commands and assertions within the framework to perform operations on the DOM elements. It internally uses the powerful W3C WebDriver API or the Selenium WebDriver and simplifies writing end to end automated tests in Node.js and effortlessly sets up for Continuous Integration.
